effectliter
=========

This package can be used to estimate average and conditional effects of a treatment variable on an outcome variable, taking into
account any number of continuous and categorical covariates. It automatically generates lavaan (Rosseel, 2012) syntax for a multi-group structural equation model, runs the model in lavaan, and extracts various average and conditional effects of interest.

effectliter is a new program based on the ideas (not the code) of EffectLite (Steyer & Partchev, 2008; www.causal-effects.de) and many (former) researchers at the Department of Methodology and Evaluation Research at Friedrich Schiller University Jena.

Installation

effectliter can be installed from this Github repository. For those not familiar with installing packages from Github, the subfolder /old contains tar.gz files (for installing from source) and Windows binaries. Please make sure all dependencies are installed (lavaan (>= 0.5-16), methods, plyr), and for the shiny interface, the additional packages shiny, Hmisc, and ggplot2 are required.
